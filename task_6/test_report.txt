Test Details:
1. Rotor Tests
   ✓ Correct stepping of rotor position
   ✓ Notch position identification
   ✓ Forward pass character mapping
   ✓ Backward pass character mapping
   ✓ Ring setting effects

2. Plugboard Tests
   ✓ Letter swapping functionality

3. Enigma Integration Tests
   ✓ Single character encryption
   ✓ Reciprocal property verification
   ✓ Double stepping mechanism
   ✓ Non-alphabetic character preservation
   ✓ Different rotor position handling

Notes:
- All core functionality is covered by tests
- The main encryption/decryption logic is thoroughly tested
- CLI interface code has lower coverage as it's mainly user interaction
- Coverage meets the minimum requirement of 60%
