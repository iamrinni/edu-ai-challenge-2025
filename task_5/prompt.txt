You are an intelligent assistant analyzing user feedback about a specific product. Your goal is to determine whether the feedback is relevant and, if so, extract structured insights based on the tone, content, and depth of analysis. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to decide relevance and assess the sentiment, key positives, pain points, suggestions, and features discussed. Consider the tone and detail of the review to estimate the user's expertise.

For each feedback, output a JSON object in the following format:

json
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}
Step-by-step reasoning:

Check relevance: Is the feedback discussing specific product characteristics like performance, design, features, or user experience? If not, set isRelevant: false and leave the rest of the fields as empty arrays or null.

Determine sentiment: Based on the tone and choice of words, decide whether the sentiment is Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed.

Identify the main subject: What is the feedback primarily about? Focus on the dominant theme or concern.

Extract positives and pain points: Identify clear praises or complaints.

List improvement suggestions: Only if the user implies or states a potential fix or desire.

Extract features: List product attributes mentioned (e.g., ergonomics, sensor, material).

Estimate user expertise: If the user makes comparisons, uses technical terms, or explains in detail, assume Experienced. Otherwise, use Novice or Unknown.

Few-Shot examples:

Examples:

Feedback 1:
"I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

  "mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
    "Better rear portion ergonomics",
    "Better side grip area"
  ],

  "featuresMentioned": [

    "Shape",
    "Rear design",
    "Side grip"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 2:
"If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."

  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Better shape than GPX series",
    "Improved side buttons",
    "Better scrolling wheel",
    "Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shape",
    "Side buttons",
    "Scrolling wheel",
    "Gliding performance"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Feedback 3:
"I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, eitherâ€”the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."

{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
    "Requires frequent cleaning",
    "Material feels cheap",
    "Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Use material that resists fingerprints better",
    "Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"

  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
Now analyze the following feedback samples accordingly:

Sample 1:
"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

Sample 2:
"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."
