### 1. Experienced Developer Review

- **Code Readability & Idiomatic Style**:
  - Instead of `for i in range(len(data))`, prefer iterating directly: `for entry in data:`. This improves readability and avoids unnecessary indexing.
  - Use f-strings rather than concatenation: `f"Processed {len(users)} users"` is more idiomatic.
  - The ternary operator inside `"active"` field can be simplified: `data[i]["status"] == "active"` already returns a boolean.

- **Modularity & Maintainability**:
  - Consider separating the logic of building a user dictionary into its own helper function for better reuse and clarity.
  - There are no docstrings or type hints. Adding these will help with understanding and tooling.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function assumes all keys exist in each dictionary of `data`. Add defensive checks or use `.get()` to avoid potential `KeyError`.

### 2. Security Engineer Review

- **Input Validation**:
  - No input validation is performed on the `data` parameter. Malformed inputs could raise exceptions. Consider validating input structure and types.

- **Sensitive Data Handling**:
  - If `email` contains personal user data, printing/logging this info may violate privacy. Avoid printing PII unless necessary and authorized.

- **Future Database Logic**:
  - While `save_to_database()` is a stub, ensure any future database logic uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Sanitization of fields like `email` should be implemented before persisting data.

- **Error Handling**:
  - No try-except blocks are in place to catch unexpected runtime errors or logging failures. Add structured error handling for robustness.

### 3. Performance Specialist Review

- **Loop Optimization**:
  - Looping via `range(len(data))` is less efficient than direct iteration, especially for large datasets due to repeated indexing.

- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Storing all user entries in memory (`users = []`) may be problematic with very large inputs. Consider using generators or streaming output.

- **Scalability**:
  - If the function processes data from an external source (e.g., a file or API), batching or chunked processing would help performance and reduce memory footprint.

- **Asynchronous Processing**:
  - If `save_to_database` performs I/O, consider implementing it asynchronously for better scalability, especially in web environments.

âœ… **Review Summary**: The code is simple and understandable, but would benefit from idiomatic Python improvements, better error handling, and preparation for security and performance scaling concerns.
