You are a senior AI assistant tasked with helping a software architect choose the most suitable type of database for a new application.
Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to solve the following task:

Task:

Analyze the given project requirements step-by-step, and justify your recommendation for the most suitable type of database (e.g., relational, NoSQL, graph, etc.). Your reasoning must be well-structured and clearly linked to each requirement.

Project Requirements:

- The application is a social platform with millions of users

- You need to store user profiles, posts, and connections (friendships/follows) between users

- The system must support high-speed data reads

- the expected workload is 80% read operations and 20% write operations

Scalability is critical as the platform will grow significantly

Instructions, follow this Chain in task resolvement:

1. Start by identifying the key characteristics of the data and access patterns.

2. Evaluate the strengths and limitations of different database types in the context of each requirement.

3. Make a final recommendation and explain why it is the best fit, considering trade-offs if applicable.

4. Present your reasoning in a clear, logical order, showing how each requirement influenced your decision.
