## Summary

This team meeting focused on improving the customer onboarding process through AI integration and outlined the Q4 roadmap. The speaker emphasized that the current onboarding process is taking too long and causing customer frustration, with only a 60% completion rate against an 85% target.

The main initiative discussed was the AI integration project, which aims to reduce onboarding time from two weeks to three days by automating manual processes. This project is expected to be a game-changer for customer experience and satisfaction scores.

The Q4 roadmap includes three phases: Phase 1 focuses on AI integration, Phase 2 on process optimization, and Phase 3 on customer feedback integration. The AI integration is planned for launch by the end of November, allowing time for feedback and adjustments before quarter-end.

The speaker highlighted the importance of the customer onboarding experience as the first real interaction customers have with the platform. The team is working to streamline the process by identifying bottlenecks and optimizing workflows through AI assistance.

The meeting concluded with an invitation for questions and feedback on both the customer onboarding process and the AI integration project, emphasizing the need to stay on track with goals and the Q4 roadmap.
